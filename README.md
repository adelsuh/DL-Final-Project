# Deep Learning Final Project
Based on the codebase of Stable Diffusion.
[**High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models**](https://ommer-lab.com/research/latent-diffusion-models/)<br/>

Generates an image based on a prompt, then modifies the results conditioning on new user-input prompts and the prompt used to create the previous image. Injects the noise of the original image into the decoding process in order to increase faithfulness to the original image.
